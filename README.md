# NicoChatPython
A Python program to make Twitch chat scroll like Nico Nico comments

Uses [Twisted](https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/) for IRC, which also uses [zope](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/zope.interface/4.1.2).

Also uses [pygame](https://www.pygame.org)

Twisted, zope, and pygame must be installed for this to function properly.
These files may or may not be included later in this repository or something to ease in downloading.

The idea behind this is to chromakey out the background and overlay the text over a stream.

It looks like this for now. Who knows if it will keep looking like this.
